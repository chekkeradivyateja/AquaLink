# AquaLink
Wireless Water Level Monitoring and Control System. 
The project aims to develop a water level monitoring and control system. A water level sensor will detect the water level and send this data to an Arduino, which is equipped with an RF link transmitter. Another Arduino with an RF link receiver will receive this data and control an automatic power switcher, which is connected to a water motor. The system will enable remote monitoring of water levels and the ability to control the water motor wirelessly, facilitating efficient water management.
